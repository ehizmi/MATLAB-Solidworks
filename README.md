# Project Description
This project combines the use of MATLAB and Solidworks in order to create a comprehensive study on the solidworks part, and to see how simulation in solidworks compares with their corresponding theoretical values. 

# Solidworks

To begin, a cylindrical beam was created using variables that accounted for length and radius. (Picture included in files). A static study was then implemented in order to simulate a beam with one fixed end and either an axial or bending load. The simulation data was then obtained by measuring the maximum stress and deflection on the beam (to keep the data consistent). A total of 7 different radii were simulated totaling in 14 measurements for deflectiona and stress measurements.

# MATLAB

MATLAB was used to do all of the theoretical calculations as well as graphing both theoretical data and Solidworks data. An example of one of the graphs as well as its code is provided in the files. 


# Conclusion
The purpose of this project was to gain a further understanding of how to graph, curve fit, and use parameters and functions. Solidworks was introduced as a way of using interdisciplinary softwares and further my ability to use both.
