# MATLAB/Solidworks
This project combines the use of MATLAB and Solidworks. 
Solidworks was used to design an object constructed with variables, then design studies were implemented in order to obtain simulation data.
The simulation data was obtained through creating a mesh and fixing its geoemtry and simulating as if the object was a beam fixed at one end.
MATLAB was used to calculate theoretical data and compare it graphically with the Solidworks data.
