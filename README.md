# MATLAB/Solidworks
# Project Description
This project combines the use of MATLAB and Solidworks in order to create a comprehensive study on the solidworks part, and to see how simulation in solidworks compares with their corresponding theoretical values. To begin, a cylindrical beam was created using variables that accounted for length and radius. A static study was then implemented in order to simulate a beam with one fixed end and either an axial or bending load. 
The simulation data was then obtained through multiple different variable values to create 7 points.
MATLAB was used to do all of the calculations and create a bezier curve fit for the data points. 
The reason for this project is to learn more about MATLAB functions including parameters, curve fitting, and graphing.
